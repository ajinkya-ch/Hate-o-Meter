this link has the .h5 model


Our product is at: https://hate-o-meter.herokuapp.com/
- It works well with large text corpus
- It is just a development prototype.
- It has various drawbacks: 
1)	Our current model cannot detect sarcastic hate statements. It is trained on the base of formal statements.
2)	The model does not comprehend sentences with less words.
3)	The API may crash or malfunction on receiving multiple requests in a row.

Thankyou, the project is open for further developments.
